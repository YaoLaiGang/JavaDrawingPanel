# Java - Play

## Description

This is a fully functional desktop drawing application, which allows the user to draw any kind of graphical image and save it on the hard drive.

1. DrawingPanel – represents the panel for drawing
2. PaintToolPanel–contains tools used for drawing
3. StrokeToolPanel–contains a JSlider used to set the width of the brush
4. StrokePanel–shows the current brush width
5. ColorPalette–contains 92 different colors the user can choose from
6. ColorButton–represents the color button the use can click on to select that color
7. ColorPanel–shows  the  current  color  and  opens  a  JColorChooser  for  selecting  additional colors
8. MenuBar–represents the application’s menu bar with several different options
9. ToolButton–represents the tool button the user can click on to select the desired tool for drawing

The sourcecode of the application consists of numerous classes and inner classes, as shown in the UML diagram below.

## Source Code Overview

The Main class starts the application and creates a new instance of the PaintApplication class.

The PaintApplication class  extends the JFrame class, and  adds  the  named  GUI  classes  to  the  main application window. In addition, the PaintApplication sets the starting color of the ColorPalette to black.

The DrawingPanelclass  contains  all  the  drawing  logic,  and  communicates  with  the ToolFactory class to get the currently selected ToolButton(containing an instance of the Tool class) and draw a corresponding shape on the screen.

The ToolFactory creates a Toolclass instance, depending on the given parameter. It also provides eleven different Tool static variables, used to distinguish the Tool instances. The caller choses from one of those constant variables, and passes it to the ToolFactory’s createTool method. In response, the ToolFactory returns the corresponding instance of the Tool class.

The PaintToolPanel class creates instances of all the ToolButton classes, and adds them to the panel. In addition it adds a mouse listener to the colorPickerButton, so that the button opens a JColorChooser on mouse click.

The PaintToolPanel also contains a JComboBox and its action event, for choosing the type of drawing shapes. If the value of the combo box is set to 0 (empty), empty shape buttons are added to the panel and the corresponding Tool classes’instantiated. If the value of the combo box is set to 1 (filled), filled shape buttons are added to the panel, and the corresponding Tool classes’instantiated.

The ToolButton class  extends  JButton  and  implements  ActionListener. Its constructor  receives  a Tool  class  instance  which  is  passed  to  the  DrawingPanel’s currentTool upon   triggering   the actionPerformed method (when the tool button is clicked).The ToolDetails class extends the Tool class and provides methods for customizing the color and the stroke of the brush.

The StrokeToolPanel class  creates  instances  of  the StrokePanel(used  to  display  the  current stroke) and JSlider(used to change the current stroke) classes, and adds them to the panel.

### The Factory Method Pattern

The ToolFactory class implements the Factory Method pattern and provides a method for creating Tool class  instances.  It  contains  eleven  static  constant  variables  used  by  the  caller  of  the  factory method to provide the corresponding input parameter, and eleven instance variables used to keep the  created Toolclass instances.  The  switch  statement  inside  of  the  method  uses  the  inputted parameter and checks if the corresponding instance is already created. If the object is null, it creates and returns the new instance.

### Drawing an Image on the Screen

The DrawingPanel class   extends   the   JPanel   class   and   implements   the   MouseListener   and MouseMotionListener interfaces. The class’ constructor customizes the panel’s appearance and creates  a  new  instance  of  the  PENCIL_TOOL Tool class  (using  the ToolFactory method)  and  the PENCIL_TOOL ToolDetailsclass,  and  assigns  them  to  the currentTooland currentToolDetailsvariables. The drawGraphics()method  is  used  to  draw  shapes  in  the  graphics context.  The Tool parameter determines which shape will be drawn, while the integer variables determine coordinates or corners of the shapes.

The mouse events are called when the user presses or moves the mouse inside of the panel. As an example, figure 6shows the source code of the mouseDragged method which is called whenever the user  moves  the  mouse  while  the  mouse  button  is  down.  If  the  useris  drawing  a  curve  (the PENCIL_TOOL, ERASER_TOOL, or AIR_BRUSH_TOOL is selected), the method draws a segment of the curve on the off-screen image, and repaints the part of the panel that contains the new line segment. Otherwise, if the user is drawing shapes, it calls repaint and lets the paintComponent()method draw the shape on top of the picture in the off-screen image.

### Changing Brush Color

The application contains three classes that deal with changing the color of the brush.

- The ToolFactory class  provides  a  COLOR_PICKER_TOOL  constant  variable  used  to  create  a new instance of the Tool class, and open a JColorChooser on button click.
- The ColorButton class represent the small color box located in the ColorPalette, and sets the color of the brush on button click
- The ColorPalette class creates  all  the ColorButton instances  with  92  different  colors
- The ColorPanel class represents the currently selected color, and opens a JColorChooser on mouse click

### Changing Brush stroke

The StrokeToolPanel class uses the JSlider to set the stroke of the brush, and a JPanel (StrokePanel) to show the currently selected stroke.

### Saving and Loading Images

The MenuBar class extends the JMenuBar and displays a menu on the top side of the application. It consists of threeJMenu classes: File, Viewand Help. The File JMenu contains New File, Open File, Save File and Exit  application menu  items,  with  corresponding  ActionListeners.  Figure  11shows  the source code of the actionPerformed method, triggered when one of the menu items is clicked.

If the New file menu item is clicked, a new BufferedImage is created and passed to the DrawingPanel class’ setImage method (so that a blank image is displayed in the panel).

If the Save file menu item if clicked, a JFileChooser is shown to the user to select the desired location on  the  hard  drive  where  the  image  will  be  saved.

Upon  clicking  OK  on  the  File  chooser,  the DrawingPanel’s getScreenShot()method is called and the received image saved on the hard drive using the ImageIO.write()method.

If the Open file menu item is clicked, a JFileChooser is shown to the user to select the desire image. The selected image is passed to the DrawingPanel’s setOSImage()method, using the ImageIO.read()method.If the Help or About menu items are clicked, a JOptionPane containing explanation text is shown to the user.
